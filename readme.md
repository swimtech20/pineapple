# Project _Pineapple_

This project allows developer candidates to display their ability to deliver clean
and usable code using AngularJS in a timely manner. Candidates will receive feedback on their coding
style, substance, and completeness following the exercise.

**You have 48 hours from the moment you receive a link to this project to deliver your Pull Request**

## Preparation

- [ ] Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed on your
development machine
- [ ] Fork this project into your personal Github repository
- [ ] Review the project's file structure to prepare for tackling deliverables
- [ ] From the command line, traverse into the project's root folder and type `npm install`
- [ ] After installation completes, type `npm start` and [open a browser window to view the
project](localhost:8080)

## Deliverables

- [ ] Add a search filter for the table of device data. The user should be able to type a string of
text and see the collection of devices update in real time.
- [ ] All tests should pass when executing `npm test` on the command line
- [ ] After you've completed your work, send us a link to your remote repository

## Bonus Deliverable

An additional (but very much optional) feature you can deliver for this project - _please ensure
full functionality of deliverables before moving on to bonus material_.

- [ ] Allow the user to sort device data by columns. The user should be able to click on a column
heading and have the content of the table sorted ascending/descending by that column.
